This repository contains a simple web based design playground. The goal is to allow basic placement of text and rectangle elements directly as real HTML elements.

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to try it out. Use the toolbar buttons to add new text blocks or rectangles. Elements can be dragged around the canvas and text elements are editable.
